# Heart Disease Model
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient based on various medical features. My goal is to create a model that can assist in the early detection of heart disease, potentially aiding healthcare professionals in decision making. This model was trained on the Kaggle Heart Disease dataset.
